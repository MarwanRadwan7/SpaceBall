# Space Ball

<p>Space Ball is a 2D PC game, you first start with 3 lives, 2 balls -purple and blue- you have to move the brick at the bottom of the screen to bounce the ball back to space in order to in crease your score and get a score higher than the highest score. Have fun! (or try to pretend like you do) :D
