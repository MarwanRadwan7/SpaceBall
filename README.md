# Space Ball

<p>Space Ball is a 2D PC game. You start with 3 lives and 2 balls - purple and blue. Your goal is to move the brick at the bottom of the screen to bounce the ball back into space, increase your score, and achieve a score higher than the highest score. Have fun! (Or try to pretend like you do!) :D
